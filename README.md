Objective: create a relational database in SQL to simulate an electronic medical record system for a small hospital. more specifically, our system keeps track of... 
- general patient info (name, address, etc.)
- medical history (conditions, medications)
- administrative info (pharmacy, insurance plan + company) 
- visits (doctor, location, date, procedures completed, any associated notes)
- general finances (invoices, payments)
