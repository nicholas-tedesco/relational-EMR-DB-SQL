## relational-EMR-DB-SQL

Objective: create relational database in SQL to simulate electronic medical record system

Context: 
- this project was completed as part of INFSCI 2710: Database Management (University of Pittsburgh) 
- besides myself, group members included Emily Conner and Yicheng Zhang
- in addition to database, Yicheng Zhang designed a user-facing application to serve as an input system for the database (I had no part in this, but thought it was a cool thing to share!)
